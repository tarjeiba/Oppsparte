[Verse 1]
Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl
And with the way you look, I understand that you are not impressed
But I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress
I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines
'Cause I don't know if you were loving somebody
I only know it isn't mine

[Chorus]
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true

[Verse 2]
Well, I see you've got a husband now
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand
I'll bet he took all he could take
Sometimes, I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say
I think somebody better put out the big light
'Cause I can't stand to see you this way

[Chorus]
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true

[Outro]
My aim is true[repeat until fade]
