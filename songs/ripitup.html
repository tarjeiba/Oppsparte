When I first saw you
Something stirred within me
You were standing sultry in the rain
If I could've held you
I would've held you
Rip it up and start again

Rip it up and start again
Rip it up and start again
I hope to God you're not as dumb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God
And I hope to God I'm not as numb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God

And when I next saw you
My heart reached out for you
My arms stuck like glue to my sides
If I could've held you
I would've held you
But I'd choke rather than swallow my pride

Rip it up and start again
Rip it up and start again
I hope to God you're not as dumb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God
And I hope to God I'm not as numb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God

And there were times I'd take my pen
And feel obliged to start again
I do profess
That there are things in life
That one can't quite express
You know me, I'm acting dumb-dumb
You know this scene is very humdrum
And my favorite song's entitled "Boredom"

Rip it up and start again
I said rip it up and start again
I said rip it up and rip it up and rip it up and rip it up
Rip it up and start again

Rip it up
Rip it up
Rip it up
Rip it up and start again
Rip it up
Rip it up
Rip it up
Rip it up
