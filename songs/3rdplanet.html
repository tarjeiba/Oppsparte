[Verse 1]
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over

[Verse 2]
My boss just quit the job
Says he's going out to find blind spots
And he'll do it

[Verse 3]
The third planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake the eye's hand

[Chorus]
Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
And baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

[Refrain]
Well, a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then; was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

[Bridge]
Well the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

[Chorus]
Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
And baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end
[Refrain]
Well, a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then; was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

[Bridge]
Well, the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

[Outro]
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over
