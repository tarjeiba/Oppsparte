[Verse 1]
Polar opposites don't push away
It's the same on the weekends as the rest of the days
And I know I should go but I will probably stay
And that's all you can do about some things

[Chorus]
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away

[Verse 2]
Two one-eyed dogs, they're looking at stereos
Hi-fi Gods try so hard to make their cars low to the ground
These vibrations oil its teeth
Primer gray is the color when you're done dying

[Chorus]
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away

[Instrumental Outro]
