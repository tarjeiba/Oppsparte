[Verse 1]
Go back to those gold sounds
And keep my advent to your self
Because it's nothing I don't like
Is it a crisis or a boring change?
When it's central, so essential
It has a nice ring when you laugh
At the low-life opinions
And they're coming to the chorus now

[Chorus 1]
I keep my address to yourself 'cause we need secrets
We need secret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –crets back right now

[Verse 2]
Because I never wanna make you feel
That you're social, never ignorant soul
Believe in what you wanna do
And do you think that is a major flaw
When they rise up in the falling rain?
And if you stay around
With your knuckles ground down
The trial's over, the weapon's found

[Chorus 1]
Keep my address to myself because it's secret
'Cause it's secret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret
–Cret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret, –cret back right now

[Verse 3]
So drunk in the August sun
And you're the kind of girl I like
Because you're empty and I'm empty
And you can never quarantine the past
Did you remember in December
That I won't need you when I'm gone?
And if I go there, I won't stay there
Because I'm sitting here too long

[Chorus 2]
I've been sitting here too long
And I've been wasted, advocating that word for the last word
Last words come up, all you've got to waste
