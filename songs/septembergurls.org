#+TITLE: Big Star - September Gurls

* Lyrics
#+begin_example
September girls
Do so much
And for so long
'Till we touched
I love you, boy
Never mind
I've been crying
All the time

December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad

September girls
I don't know why
How can I deny
What's inside
Even though I
Keep away
They will love
All our days

December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad

When I get to bed
Late at night
That's the time he
Makes things right
Ooh when he makes
Love to me
