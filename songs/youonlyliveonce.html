[Verse 1]
Some people think they're always right
Others are quiet and uptight
Others, they seem so very nice-nice-nice-nice, oh
Inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh no
Twenty-nine different attributes
Only seven that you like, oh
Twenty ways to see the world, oh
And twenty ways to start a fight, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, don't, don't, don't get up!
I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down!
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

[Verse 2]
Oh, men don't notice what they got
Oh, women think of that a lot
One thousand ways to please your man, oh
Not even one requires a plan, I know
And countless odd religions too
It doesn't matter which you choose, oh no
One stubborn way to turn your back, oh
This I've tried and now refuse, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, don't, don't, don't get up!
I can't see the sunshine
Oh, I'll be waiting for you, baby
'Cause I'm through
Sit me down!
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you, alright

[Outro]
Shut me up
Shut me up
And I'll get along with you
