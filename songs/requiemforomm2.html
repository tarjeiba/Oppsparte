When I met you, I was just a kid -- hadn't built up my defenses.
So I gave my heart completely -- Vaseline all over the lenses.
Memories don't go away; I remember every day.

I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us.
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.

I remember feeling like a ship whose captain was too drunk to steer.
And you watched as I was sinking, waving sadly from the pier.
Memories don't go away; I remember every day.

I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us.
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.

It's such a burden to carry 'round the vestiges of dead dreams,
And I don't want to make a wake out of my life.
I just had to let you go...
