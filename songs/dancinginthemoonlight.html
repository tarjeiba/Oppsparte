[Verse 1]
When I passed you in the doorway
Well you took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance
Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
And my father he's going crazy
He says I'm living in a trance

[Chorus]
But I'm dancing in the moonlight
Its caught me in its spotlight (It's alright, alright)
Said I'm dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night

[Verse 2]
It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
I disobeyed another warning
I should've been in by ten
Now I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
Oh, but it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the ends

[Chorus]
Dancing in the moonlight
Its caught me in its spotlight (It's alright, alright)
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night

[Bridge]
And I'm walking home
The last bus is long gone
But I'm dancing in the moonlight

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Dancing in the moonlight
Its caught me in its spotlight (It's alright, alright)
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night
Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing in the moonlight)
Its caught me in its spotlight (Its caught me in its spotlight)
Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing in the moonlight)
On this long, hot summer night (Its got me hot)
Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing in the moonlight)
Its caught me in its spotlight (Its caught me alright, alright)
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night (It's so goddamn hot)
Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing)
Its caught me in its spotlight (I'm still dancing)
Dancing in the moonlight (I'm dancing in the moonlight)
