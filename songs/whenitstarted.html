Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks my friend, thought it was too late."
Oh, why, oh, why? I don't know
So you think things move pretty fast down here?
Well, just wait, my dear, 'til you look up there
Oh, maybe someday you'll know
Had his second kid, was an early night
Got to be well-dressed, 'cause he hates to fly
Oh, loves his job, takes it home

Anything they wanted
They could have it, have it
Didn't even notice
I don't mind it, mind it

Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks my friend, thought that we was dead."
Oh why, oh, why? I don't know
Think things move pretty fast down here?
But just wait, my dear, 'til we get up there
Oh, maybe someday, they'll know

Come on, tell me does she warm the room
When he comes?
Or does he just know
How to leave when it gets cold?

Well, I don't care, I don't care
'Cause it's free
